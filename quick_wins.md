# Quick Wins Refactoring Progress

## Overview
Following Option 2 from REFACTORING_PLAN.md - the recommended quick wins approach.

**Goal**: 70% of benefit with 25% of effort

## Commits Plan (4 commits, 5-7 hours estimated)

### Commit 1: Split xml.go → xml/ package ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: Completed
**Files created**:
- [x] pkg/stencil/xml/types.go (Core types and interfaces - 42 lines)
- [x] pkg/stencil/xml/document.go (Document and Body structures - 179 lines)
- [x] pkg/stencil/xml/paragraph.go (Paragraph structures - 586 lines)
- [x] pkg/stencil/xml/run.go (Run and text structures - 341 lines)
- [x] pkg/stencil/xml/table.go (Table structures - 562 lines)

**Files updated**:
- [x] pkg/stencil/xml.go (Now 88 lines of re-exports, was 1748 lines)
- [x] pkg/stencil/render.go (Fixed fragment type check for xml.Break)

**Outcome**:
- xml.go reduced from 1,748 lines to 88 lines (95% reduction)
- Code split into 5 logical files totaling 1,710 lines
- All tests passing
- Full backward compatibility maintained

### Commit 2: Split render_docx.go → render/ package ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: Completed (split into sub-commits 2a-2e)
**Achievement**: Extracted all pure helper functions (607 lines) to render/ package
**Outcome**:
- render/ package now has 4 files: helpers.go (187), control.go (208), body.go (78), table.go (134)
- render_docx.go reduced from ~2,270 lines to 1,663 lines (27% reduction)
- All tests passing ✅
- Clean architecture without circular dependencies ✅

---

#### Commit 2a: Extract helper functions (run merging) ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: Completed
**Files created**:
- [x] pkg/stencil/render/helpers.go (187 lines)
  - MergeConsecutiveRuns() (exported)
  - mergeConsecutiveRunsWithContent()
  - mergeRunSlice()

**Files updated**:
- [x] pkg/stencil/render_docx.go (Removed extracted functions, added import)
- [x] All test files updated to use render.MergeConsecutiveRuns()

**Outcome**:
- render_docx.go reduced from ~2136 to 1956 lines (180 lines extracted)
- 187 lines moved to render/helpers.go
- All tests passing
- No import cycles (uses xml package types directly)

---

#### Commit 2b: Extract control structure functions ✅ COMPLETED
**Status**: Completed
**Files created**:
- [x] pkg/stencil/render/control.go (208 lines)
  - DetectControlStructure() (exported)
  - GetParagraphText() (exported)
  - FindMatchingEnd() (exported)

**Files updated**:
- [x] pkg/stencil/render_docx.go (Replaced implementations with wrappers)

**Outcome**:
- render_docx.go reduced from ~1956 to 1767 lines (189 lines extracted)
- 208 lines in render/control.go
- All tests passing
- Note: Token-dependent functions (renderInlineForLoop, processTemplateText, etc.) remain in render_docx.go to avoid circular dependencies. These will be extracted in a future commit after proper abstraction.

---

#### Commit 2c: Extract body rendering helper functions ✅ DONE
**Status**: Completed
**Files created**:
- [x] pkg/stencil/render/body.go
  - ElseBranch type (exported for use in render_docx.go)
  - FindMatchingEndInElements() - finds matching {{end}} for control structures
  - FindIfStructureInElements() - finds if/elsif/else branch structure

**Note**: Only pure helper functions were extracted to avoid circular dependencies.
The main rendering orchestration functions (renderElementsWithContext, RenderBodyWithControlStructures,
renderBodyWithElementOrder) remain in render_docx.go as they call back into the stencil package.

**Files updated**:
- [x] pkg/stencil/render_docx.go (Added wrappers for extracted functions)

**Expected outcome**: Helper functions extracted, tests passing ✅

---

#### Commit 2d: Extract table rendering helper functions ✅ DONE
**Status**: Completed
**Files created**:
- [x] pkg/stencil/render/table.go
  - DetectTableRowControlStructure() - detects control structures in table rows
  - FindMatchingTableEnd() - finds matching {{end}} for table control structures
  - FindMatchingTableIfEnd() - finds if/elsif/else branches in tables
  - FindMatchingTableEndInSlice() - finds matching {{end}} in row slices
  - FindMatchingTableIfEndInSlice() - finds if/elsif/else branches in row slices

**Note**: Only pure helper functions were extracted to avoid circular dependencies.
The main table rendering functions (RenderTableWithControlStructures, renderTableForLoop,
renderTableIfElse, renderTableUnlessElse) remain in render_docx.go as they call back
into the stencil package.

**Files updated**:
- [x] pkg/stencil/render_docx.go (Added wrappers for extracted functions)

**Expected outcome**: Table helper functions extracted, tests passing ✅

---

#### Commit 2e: Final state - Refactoring complete ✅ DONE
**Status**: Refactoring complete to the extent architecturally sound
**What was accomplished**:
- [x] Extracted all pure helper functions to render/ package
- [x] body.go: Body element control structure matching
- [x] table.go: Table row control structure matching
- [x] control.go: Control structure detection (from 2b)
- [x] helpers.go: Run merging utilities (from 2a)
- [x] All tests passing

**What remains in render_docx.go** (~1300 lines):
- Main orchestration functions that call back into stencil package
- Token processing (renderInlineForLoop, processTemplateText, etc.)
- Rendering functions (RenderBodyWithControlStructures, RenderTableWithControlStructures, etc.)
- These MUST remain to avoid circular import: render → stencil ❌

**Final architecture**:
```
pkg/stencil/
├── xml/                    # Pure XML structures
├── render/                # Pure rendering helpers
│   ├── control.go         # Control structure detection
│   ├── helpers.go         # Run merging
│   ├── body.go           # Body element helpers
│   └── table.go          # Table row helpers
├── render_docx.go         # Rendering orchestration (calls stencil types/functions)
└── ...                    # Expression, tokenizer, etc.
```

**Note**: Cannot reduce render_docx.go further without introducing circular dependencies.
The current architecture is clean and maintainable.

### Commit 3: Move functions to functions/ package ⏳ PENDING
**Status**: Not started
**Files to move/reorganize**:
- [ ] pkg/stencil/functions/*.go → functions/ subpackages
- [ ] Create functions/string/, functions/math/, functions/date/, etc.

**Files to update**:
- [ ] pkg/stencil/functions.go (Add re-exports)
- [ ] Update imports across codebase

**Expected outcome**: Better organization of 30+ function files

---

### Commit 4: Add package documentation ⏳ PENDING
**Status**: Not started
**Files to update**:
- [ ] pkg/stencil/xml/doc.go
- [ ] pkg/stencil/render/doc.go
- [ ] pkg/stencil/functions/doc.go
- [ ] Update pkg/stencil/doc.go

**Expected outcome**: Comprehensive package-level documentation

---

## Current Status
- **Commits completed**: 3 / 9 (Commit 1 done, Commit 2a done, Commit 2b done)
- **Estimated time remaining**: 2.5-4 hours
- **Next action**: Continue with Commit 2c - Extract body rendering functions

## Notes
- Keeping re-exports permanently (Option A from REFACTORING_PLAN.md)
- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Each commit should pass all tests
